Update
-----
New name : Find your tab with tab<TAB>
You can now jump to a tab located in another window


Stop wasting your time clicking on hundreds of tabs!
-------------

This extension lets you instead search through your opened tabs to jumb directly to the one you need right now.

It's a [search engine](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95655) associated with the 'tab' keyword.

In practice, you enter `tab` in Chrome's address bar, then the <TAB> key, then a keyword which is part of the URL or website's name you are looking for

Why and How you can use this Chrome Extension
--------

Scenario : you begin to browse the web with Chrome for a while ; soon you need to go back to *that* tab but there are too many tabs to find quickly exactly the one you need. Sound familiar ? We know we have been there.

Don't worry, to solve this *too many tabs* problem, there are a lot of complicated extensions that promise you that you will be able to work with hundreds of tabs : *Too Many Tabs, Tabs Outliner, Bookmark My Tabs, One Tab, TabMan Tabs Manger, Tab Manager, Project Tab Manger, 10+Tabs MASTER →Fast Speed Scroll w/LATER Tab, Resolver Tabs, Tab out, TabJump, TabCaroussel, IE Tab Multi*

Or you can use this chrome extension, but I'm a bit ashamed to say that it is *really simple* campared to all those sophisticated extensions.

The only thing it does is that when you enter in Chrome's Omnibox **"tab<tab>"** followed by **<one or many search term>**, it will display a list of all open tabs that contains those search terms.

Upon pressing enter, the extension will select the first match and switch to
that tab, so one need not type press down if the first match is desired.

How to use it ? Install it from Chrome's WebStore


== History

(‘Switch to tab’](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switch-to-tab/gbfhhcljihbgcobpfnceegfmooomhhli) was the result of (aboodman](https://github.com/aboodman/switch-to-tab
)  playing around with Chromium's experimental
omnibox API. Simple but useful idea : type "sw<tab>" in Chrome's Omnibox and you could find the tab you needed. I liked the idea a lot.

But after a few months I realized that I rarely used that extension, while it could have been often useful. What was wrong ?

Something that looks stupid : I never remembered the "sw" keyword. As an experiment I changed the keyword to "tab" (not much longer than "sw", no?) and I began to use much more.
- a small step for programmer
- a big step for usability, especially for the non-native english speaker
among us

Sadly enough, after discussing with aboodman, I understood that it was not possible to merge my change in his extension. It's an old project for him, and what's more, changing the keyword would disturb existing users (which I agree is not a good idea).

Hence this fork.
